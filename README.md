# fundamentals_of_neural_networks
This repository includes the building blocks of a general neural network. It is written by me step by step, and aimed to explain "the mysterious process" behind neural networks.  You can find explanation of the algorithms like forward-propagation, back-propagation, gradient descent, and much more there! Take a look!
